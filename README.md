# Believe or not believe
There is my version of popular russian card game. The rules are very simple, a player chooses up to 3 cards on his 
board , chooses the suit from dropdown and clicks "Add selected". 
Another player will see received cards marked as "Unknown" and "promised" suit of them. 
He decides : Do they really match with the suit? If the second player trusts, he will have to add his set of cards 
with the same suit, if he doesnt he presses "I don`t believe you!". In that case the last set of cards will be shown
to him and the loser takes them to himself.
The player who gives all the cards is a winner!

# How to run

In the current version you should run server.php in the root.
The game will start when 2 players open the page.
Good game!
